Greetings and welcome.<br>
Barbara Ann Kipfer once<br>
wrote that <em>"The best way<br><br>
to make something last<br>
is to believe that it won't."</em><br>
Too true, Barbara.<br><br>
Farewell and goodbye.<br>
Thanks for all the memories,<br>
emails and ideas.<br><br>
It gave me great joy<br>
to see my work being used.<br>
<em>Mogami River.</em><br>
